Python Programming Intro

Python is a computer programming language often used to build websites and software, automate tasks, and analyse data. 
Python is a general-purpose language, not specialised for any specific problems, and used to create various programmes.
Python's syntax is a lot closer to English and so it is easier to read and write, making it the simplest type of code to learn how to write and develop with.
