Machine Learning Intro

Machine learning (ML) is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) and computer science that focuses on using data and algorithms to enable AI systems to learn, improve, and make predictions without being explicitly programmed. 
It involves training models to identify patterns in data to perform tasks like classification, regression, or generation. 

Key Aspects of Machine Learning:

Types of ML: The four most common types are supervised learning (using labeled data), unsupervised learning (finding patterns in unlabeled data), semi-supervised learning, and reinforcement learning (trial-and-error).

How it Works: ML algorithms analyze large amounts of data to create a model, which then makes decisions or predictions.

Common Applications: Used for object detection, anomaly detection, recommendation systems (e.g., Netflix, Amazon), natural language processing, and chatbots.

Algorithms: Popular techniques include neural networks, decision trees, and random forests.
